Requirements:

virtual-box
raspbian stretch linux distro
node >  8
mongo
git
arp-scan


VM setup:

Setting Up VM with Debian:

DL virtual box

New	- add name - linux - other 32-bit

create virtual hard disk, type = VDI, storage = Dynamically allocated

Then: go to Storage tab and add Optical Disk existing image 2017-11-16-rpd-x86-stretch.iso
    (dl’d from https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-desktop/)

Then: go to Network tab and set attached to: Bridged adapter 
    (so that we aren’t NAT’d and we can see and talk to either other on the network)

Then Start VM, install and run defaults except with rooter step

Optional, Makes it easier to work on VM headless:
Set up ssh: ifconfig on pi to get ip address
on local machine run ssh pi@ip address - now you can run commands for the pi on local machine

Application Setup:

install node on pi
https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions

curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

Mongo:
sudo apt-get install mongodb-server

Update all packages:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get  (???)

other dependencies to install:
sudo apt-get install arp-scan (scans network to see what devices are available, requires sudo?)
sudo apt-get install build-essential (already in pi)

clone git repo:
git clone https://github.com/ivanthemonkey/rsci.git

npm install in pi work/rsci and work/rsci/rsci_ui
